## Overview

This repository contains Dockerfiles and configuration files for creating a **versatile bioinformatics environment** that focuses on single-cell RNA-seq and epigenomics workflows. It packages:

- **R** (v4.4.2) and comprehensive single-cell and genomic libraries (Seurat, ArchR, Bioconductor ecosystem, etc.).
- **Python** (v3.10) with scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scVI, Scanpy, etc.).
- Command-line tools focused on epigenomics-friendly workflows: **samtools**, **bcftools**, **bedtools**, and selected extras (e.g., **scIBD** for scATAC doublet detection). Bulk aligners and pre-processing tools (STAR, BWA, Salmon, kallisto, Picard, FastQC/Trimmomatic, Trim Galore, featureCounts, etc.) are intentionally excluded to keep the image slim. Use pipeline-specific containers if you need them.

The Docker setup is integrated with **VS Code Remote Containers** to streamline development on remote compute nodes—ideal for large-scale single-cell data processing.

---

## Features

- **R** with a rich set of CRAN and Bioconductor packages for single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis.
- **Python** environment (virtualenv) preloaded with popular data science packages, single-cell toolkits, and epigenomics libraries.
- **CLI Tools** focused on downstream and epigenomics analysis (samtools, bcftools, bedtools) plus **scIBD**. Heavy aligners and trimming/QC tools are excluded to reduce image size.
- **Quarto** for R Markdown, Jupyter, and scientific documentation workflows.
- **Automated Build** process (via .devcontainer/Dockerfile) including compilation of R, specialized R packages, and Python requirements.
- **VS Code** integration with recommended extensions for R, Python, Docker, Markdown, and more.

## Usage Guide

### Building the image (with renv snapshot)

From the repository root (non-root runtime, nf-core style UID/GID passthrough baked in):

```bash
# First build: installs R packages and snapshots with renv
docker build . \
  -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg GITHUB_PAT=$GITHUB_PAT \
  --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u) \
  --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
  --build-arg USER=$USER \
  --build-arg GROUP=$(id -gn) \
  -t scdock-r-dev:v0.4.0
```

- GITHUB_PAT is optional but recommended to avoid GitHub API rate limits during R package installs.
- USER_ID/GROUP_ID/USER/GROUP align the container user with your host user for mounted volume permissions.

### R package pinning with renv

- Purpose: renv captures exact R/CRAN/Bioconductor/GitHub package versions for deterministic rebuilds.
- First build (no lock present):
  - `install_R_packages.R` installs packages (CRAN snapshot + Bioc 3.20).
  - renv snapshots to `/opt/settings/renv.lock`.
  - A human-readable CSV is written to `/opt/settings/R-packages-manifest.csv`.
- After the first successful build, extract and commit the lock and manifest:

```bash
CID=$(docker create scdock-r-dev:v0.4.0)
docker cp $CID:/opt/settings/renv.lock ./renv.lock
docker cp $CID:/opt/settings/R-packages-manifest.csv ./R-packages-manifest.csv
docker rm $CID

git add renv.lock R-packages-manifest.csv
git commit -m "Pin R via renv; add manifest"
```

- Deterministic builds thereafter: uncomment the lock copy in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
# COPY renv.lock /opt/settings/renv.lock
```

Rebuild and the image will restore via `renv::restore()` from the committed lockfile.

Tip: You can set a CRAN snapshot date with `RSPM_SNAPSHOT` (see `install_R_packages.R`) to reproduce historical CRAN states.

#### Handling GitHub PAT (optional)
- Export for the build session to avoid rate limits during GitHub installs:
```bash
export GITHUB_PAT=ghp_your_token_here
```
- Unset after builds if desired:
```bash
unset GITHUB_PAT
```

### Python environments (base vs squid)

Two venvs are preinstalled and fully resolved during the image build:
- `/opt/venvs/base` from `/opt/environments/base_requirements.txt`
- `/opt/venvs/squid` from `/opt/environments/squid_requirements.txt`

Default PATH uses the base venv. Switch interactively inside the container:

```bash
usepy squid      # switch shell to squid env
usepy atac       # switch shell to ATAC env (snapatac2)
usepy comms      # switch shell to COMMS env (LR/GRN)
usepy base       # switch back to base env
```

One-off commands under a specific env:

```bash
py-squid python -V
py-atac python -V
py-comms python -V
py-base python -V
```

Verify which env is active:

```bash
which python && python -V && pip list | head
```

### Version pinning strategy

- R: renv.lock (commit it; enable restore via `COPY renv.lock /opt/settings/renv.lock`).
- Python: `.environments/*.txt` (pin versions there and commit).
- CLI tools: pinned by explicit versions/tags in `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`.
- Image: tag builds explicitly (e.g., `-t scdock-r-dev:v0.3`).

## Architecture: Compose vs Dev Containers and the Image Stack

This repo supports two ways to run your development environment:

- Dev Containers with a single image (simple): `devcontainer.json` uses an `image:` directly.
- Dev Containers with Docker Compose (multi-service): `devcontainer.json` references `docker-compose.yml` and selects a `service:`.

Role of `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:
- Defines two services that both mount the same workspace and run as your UID/GID:
  - `dev-core`: uses image `scdock-r-dev` (R+Python baseline)
  - `dev-archr`: uses image `scdock-r-archr` (adds ArchR in isolated R library)
- Bring up either or both containers, attach VS Code to one, and keep mounts/permissions consistent.

How this aligns with a single-image `devcontainer.json`:
- Instead of specifying `"image": "scdock-r-dev:…"`, you set:
  - `"dockerComposeFile": ".devcontainer/docker-compose.yml"`
  - `"service": "dev-archr"` (recommended default) or `"dev-core"`
- VS Code then starts the chosen service container with the same mounts. Switch by changing `service` or attach to the running container.

Image lineage (Docker layering; not an image-inside-image):

```text
ubuntu:22.04
  └─ scdock-r-dev:v0.4.1 (.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
       • System deps, R 4.4.2 built from source
       • R packages via install_R_packages.R, pinned with renv by install_renv_project.R
       • Python venvs: /opt/venvs/{base,squid,atac,comms} from .environments/*.txt
       • CLI tools (samtools/bcftools/bedtools), Quarto
       • Wrappers: usepy, py-*, r-base, r-archr
       • httpgd installed via install_httpgd.R (CRAN-first, GitHub-fallback)

  └─ scdock-r-archr:v0.4.1 (.devcontainer/Dockerfile.archr; FROM scdock-r-dev:v0.4.1)
       • install_R_archr.R installs ArchR into ARCHR_LIB (separate R lib path)
       • Ensures macs2 compatibility (symlink if only macs3 exists)
       • Uses same r-base/r-archr wrappers (r-archr sets USE_ARCHR=1)
```

Runtime hooks and interop:
- `.Rprofile` (interactive-only): enables httpgd in VS Code; prepends `ARCHR_LIB` to `.libPaths()` when `USE_ARCHR=1`.
- `poststart_sanity.sh`: OK/NOT OK for Python, R, httpgd, Scanpy, default venv.
- Radian wrappers: `r-base` (base libs) and `r-archr` (sets `USE_ARCHR=1`).

Compose + Dev Containers flow (when using compose):

```text
Host VS Code
  └─ devcontainer.json
       └─ dockerComposeFile -> .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml
            ├─ service: dev-core  -> container from scdock-r-dev:v0.4.1
            └─ service: dev-archr -> container from scdock-r-archr:v0.4.1

Inside scdock-r-dev:
  - install_renv_project.R  (renv init/restore or snapshot)
  - install_httpgd.R        (httpgd install with fallback)
  - install_R_packages.R    (package set used by renv on first build)
  - Python venv setup       (base/squid/atac/comms)
  - poststart_sanity.sh     (run at container start)
```

When to prefer compose:
- You want both `base` and `archr` containers available with identical mounts/UIDs.
- You want to switch VS Code between them by toggling `service` or attaching to a running container.

If you prefer the simpler flow, keep using a single-image `devcontainer.json`. Compose is optional but convenient for multi-variant setups.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your local machine or remote server.
- (Optional) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) extensions installed if you plan to develop within VS Code.

> **Note**: If you plan to install packages from private GitHub repositories or use GitHub-limited APIs, you may need a **GitHub Personal Access Token**. Set it as a build argument `GITHUB_PAT` when you build the image.

### Build the Image

From the root of this repository, run:

```bash
docker build . \
    -f ./.devcontainer/Dockerfile \
    --build-arg GITHUB_PAT=<your_github_pat> \
    --build-arg R_VERSION_MAJOR=4 \
    --build-arg R_VERSION_MINOR=4 \
    --build-arg R_VERSION_PATCH=2 \
    -t scdock-r-dev:v0.2
```

- **`GITHUB_PAT`** (optional) is used to authenticate GitHub requests during R package installation (especially if you hit rate limits).
- Adjust **R_VERSION_*** build arguments as needed to override the default R version. But beware the build was only tested by myself for the R 4.4.2, and some of the R libraries depend on R version no older than 4.3-4.4

### Build the ArchR variant image

```bash
docker build /data1/users/antonz/pipeline/scbio-docker \
  -f /data1/users/antonz/pipeline/scbio-docker/.devcontainer/Dockerfile.archr \
  --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=scdock-r-dev:v0.4.0 \
  -t scdock-r-archr:v0.4.0
```

Sanity check:

```bash
docker run --rm scdock-r-archr:v0.4.0 bash -lc 'whoami && R -q -e "packageVersion(\"ArchR\")"'
```

## Typical Workflow for New Projects

After you’ve successfully built and tested your Docker image (e.g., `scdock-r-dev:v0.2`), you can quickly spin up a new analysis project by following these steps:

1. **Create a folder** for the analysis. For example:
   ```bash
   mkdir Yasmine-retroT && cd Yasmine-retroT
   ```

2. **Create `.devcontainer` and `.vscode` subfolders** inside your project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir .devcontainer .vscode
   ```

3. Use docker-compose with two services (base and archr). Use the same mounts on both services.

```yaml
# .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  base:
    image: scdock-r-dev:v0.4.0
    user: "${LOCAL_UID:-1000}:${LOCAL_GID:-1000}"
    working_dir: /workspaces/project
    volumes:
      - ${WORKSPACE_FOLDER}:/workspaces/project
      - /path/to/data:/workspaces/project/00_Data:ro
  archr:
    image: scdock-r-archr:v0.4.0
    user: "${LOCAL_UID:-1000}:${LOCAL_GID:-1000}"
    working_dir: /workspaces/project
    volumes:
      - ${WORKSPACE_FOLDER}:/workspaces/project
      - /path/to/data:/workspaces/project/00_Data:ro
```

```jsonc
// .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "project",
  "dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
  "service": "dev-archr",
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/project",
  "customizations": { "vscode": { "extensions": [
    "reditorsupport.r", "ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers", "ms-python.python"
  ]}}
}
```

4. **Add a `settings.json`** to `.vscode` to configure R settings, radian, etc.:
   ```jsonc
   // .vscode/settings.json
   {
       "r.alwaysUseActiveTerminal": true,
       "r.bracketedPaste": true,
       "r.rterm.linux": "/opt/venvs/base/bin/radian",
       "r.sessionWatcher": true,
       "r.plot.useHttpgd": true,
       "r.lsp.diagnostics": false
   }
   ```

5. **Open the project in VS Code**. Then:
   - Press `Cmd+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) and type:
     ```
     >Dev Containers: Build & Attach
     ```
   - Select the **Dev Container** you just defined (service `base`).
   - To switch to ArchR: change `service` to `archr` and Reopen in Container.
   - Or run both services, then use “Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container” to attach a second VS Code window to `archr`.

7. **Long-running tasks**: For tasks that must continue even if you disconnect (like heavy alignment or processing), you can use `tmux` inside the container:
   ```bash
   tmux new -s your_session_name
   # run your alignment/analysis steps
   # detach with Ctrl+B, then D
   ```
   This ensures your process remains running if your SSH or VS Code session is interrupted.

## Operating the images and containers

### Manual runs (without VS Code)

Base image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v /path/to/project:/workspaces/project \
  -v /path/to/data:/workspaces/project/00_Data:ro \
  --memory=450g --cpus=50 \
  scdock-r-dev:v0.4.0 bash
```

ArchR image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v /path/to/project:/workspaces/project \
  -v /path/to/data:/workspaces/project/00_Data:ro \
  --memory=450g --cpus=50 \
  scdock-r-archr:v0.4.0 bash
```

Inside the container:

```bash
# regular R (radian)
r-base    # wrapper to start radian without ArchR toggle

# ArchR session (uses separate ArchR library path)
r-archr   # wrapper sets USE_ARCHR=1 then starts radian

# Manual toggle (if wrappers unavailable)
export USE_ARCHR=1
radian

Note: ArchR and its extras are installed into a separate R library path (ARCHR_LIB, default ~/R/archr-lib). With USE_ARCHR=1, this path is prepended to .libPaths(), so ArchR’s versions take precedence without altering the base R library.
```

If wrappers are not in PATH, toggle manually:

```bash
USE_ARCHR=1 radian
```

### Compose runs (without VS Code)

From your project directory containing `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
export LOCAL_UID=$(id -u); export LOCAL_GID=$(id -g); export WORKSPACE_FOLDER=$PWD
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d base
# or
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d archr
```

Enter a shell:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml exec base bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml exec archr bash
```

Stop:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down
```

### Nextflow/nf-core style runtime

```groovy
profiles {
  docker {
    docker.enabled = true
    docker.runOptions   = "-u ${System.env.NXF_UID ?: '1000'}:${System.env.NXF_GID ?: '1000'} -v /data2/nxf_tmp:/tmp"
    docker.fixOwnership = true
  }
}
```

### Tips
- VS Code: exclude heavy I/O paths in `.vscode/settings.json` to speed up indexing.
- Reproducibility: commit `renv.lock` and enable the `COPY renv.lock` line in the Dockerfile.
- MACS: MACS3 comes from Python; the ArchR image symlinks `macs2` if only `macs3` exists.
- Cairo: R Cairo package optional; ArchR works without it (plots vectorized).
- GSL: libgsl is installed in the base image.

### Engineering notes (Dev Container robustness)
- `.Rprofile` is safe and interactive-only; it checks for `~/.vscode-R/init.R` and enables httpgd only inside VS Code. This prevents crashes during non-interactive installs.
- A site-wide CRAN mirror is set at `/etc/R/Rprofile.site`, so scripted installs never see `@CRAN@`.
- When invoking R in automated steps, the build uses `R --vanilla` and explicit repos to avoid reading user/site profiles unexpectedly.
- For any postCreate scripts you add later, prefer:
  ```bash
  R_PROFILE_USER=/dev/null R_ENVIRON_USER=/dev/null Rscript --vanilla your_script.R
  ```

---

## Installing R packages and writing results inside the container

- Runtime R installs go to a user-writable library first (`~/.R/...` via `R_LIBS_USER`). This means you can install with:
```r
install.packages("GSVA")
BiocManager::install("GSVA")
```
No sudo is needed; packages land in your home library. If you switch to the ArchR session (`r-archr`), its library path is prepended for ArchR-related packages while still keeping your user library writable and visible.

- Creating output folders: R won’t create intermediate directories for `saveRDS`. Ensure the path exists before writing:
```r
dir.create("03_Results/DEG", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
saveRDS(dge, "03_Results/DEG/preprocessed_DGEList.rds")
```
- If you bind-mount the workspace, make sure the host path is writable by your UID/GID (the container runs as your host IDs). Adjust permissions on the host if needed.

---

## Included Tools & Packages

1. **R** (v4.4.2) and key single-cell packages
   - CRAN: `tidyverse`, `ragg`, `devtools`, etc.
   - Bioconductor: `Seurat`, `SingleCellExperiment`, `DESeq2`, `ArchR`, etc.
   - GitHub: Additional packages like `Signac`, `DoubletFinder`, and more.

2. **Python** (v3.10) environment
   - Data science libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, ...
   - Single-cell: `scanpy`, `scvi-tools`, `squidpy`, `scvelo`, etc.
   - Epigenomics: `MACS3`, `episcanpy`, ...

3. **System Tools** 
   - Compiler toolchain, Java, TeX packages, etc. (for building R from source and generating PDFs).
   - Epigenomics-oriented CLI: **samtools**, **bcftools**, **bedtools**, and **scIBD**; heavy aligners and trimming/QC tools are intentionally excluded for a slim image.

4. **Quarto** for rendering R Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks, and other scientific documents.

See the [Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile) and [install_R_packages.R](./.devcontainer/install_R_packages.R) for full details on what gets installed.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Permission Errors**:  
   If you run into file permission issues when mounting a host directory, ensure the container user matches your host user `UID`/`GID`. You can do this by passing additional build/run arguments (e.g., `--build-arg USER_ID=1001 --build-arg GROUP_ID=1001`). Or, adjust folder permissions on the host.

2. **Out-of-Memory Errors**:  
   Large single-cell data analyses can require significant RAM. Assign more memory/CPU to Docker if you’re on Docker Desktop, or scale up your server if you’re remote.

3. **GitHub Rate Limits**:  
   If you see error messages about rate limits or missing Git credentials, try setting a GitHub PAT:  
   ```bash
   docker build . \
       -f ./.devcontainer/Dockerfile \
       --build-arg GITHUB_PAT=<your_github_pat> \
       -t scdock-r-dev:latest
   ```

4. **R Package Version Mismatch**:  
   Libraries compiled under a different R version might cause “object not found” or `.so` loading errors. Rebuild the container with consistent R version arguments or reinstall packages inside the container to match R’s version.

---

## Backlog and roadmap

This section reflects the current design (dev-core vs dev-archr) and what remains to validate or improve.

### Now
- Build v0.4.1 images and validate
  - dev-core: build and run `.devcontainer/scripts/poststart_sanity.sh`
  - dev-archr: build and validate ArchR (`library(ArchR)`) and macs2 symlink
- Validate httpgd in VS Code radian; ensure fallback works as documented
- Smoke-test Python venvs: base/squid/atac/comms core imports

### Next
- Decide scGLUE TensorFlow wheels strategy (pin `tensorflow-cpu` vs runtime optional)
- Document `scenicplus` runtime install and known dependency pins in COMMS env
- Add round-trip QA script for `.h5mu`/`.h5ad` conversions (embeddings/graphs/layers checks)
- Make `dev-archr` the recommended default in templates/examples
- Add a training example (RNA+ATAC) in `02_Analysis` showing R↔Python interop

### Later
- Add CI smoke tests for sanity script and env imports
- Consider slim (no toolchain) and GPU variants; document supported scopes
- Evaluate packaging some shared R functionality as internal packages

---

## Working with shared code inside the container

For shared code I used to mount its external Git repo inside the container, and tracked changes of shared code separately. This works, but there are more maintainable options. Below are three patterns, from most recommended to situational.

### 1) Git submodule (recommended)
Keep shared code as a submodule within your project tree. Benefits: pins an exact commit per project, single Git workflow from VS Code, no separate mounts.

Add the submodule:
```bash
cd /scratch/current/antonz/projects/13036-DM_DMlab_summer_2025
git submodule add git@github.com:tony-zhelonkin/R_GSEA_visualisations.git 01_Scripts/shared
```

Daily usage:
```bash
# Parent repo (your analysis project)
git status
# If the submodule commit changed, parent sees it as modified

# Work inside the submodule itself
cd 01_Scripts/shared
git checkout main
git pull                 # or edit, commit, push here
# After changes:
cd ../..
git add 01_Scripts/shared
git commit -m "Update shared scripts to latest"
git push
```

Cloning a project with submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-project-repo>
# or
git clone <your-project-repo>
cd <repo>
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

VS Code devcontainer: nothing special required; the submodule lives inside the workspace and is tracked by the parent repo. Use it like any folder in `01_Scripts/shared`.

### 2) R package for shared code
If the shared code becomes stable and broadly reused, convert it to an R package for cleaner dependency management and versioning.

Install in the container:
```r
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tony-zhelonkin/R_GSEA_visualisations")
```
Pros: semantic versioning, DESCRIPTION-based deps, easy to pin via renv. Cons: more overhead to structure as a package.

### 3) External mount (works, but less ideal)
Mount an external shared repo into your container, and manage its Git lifecycle in another terminal outside the container.

Example devcontainer.json optional mount:
```jsonc
"mounts": [
  "source=/data1/users/antonz/pipeline/R_GSEA_visualisations,\
   target=/workspaces/project/01_Scripts/shared,\
   type=bind"
]
```
Caveats: two Git flows; easier to drift. Prefer submodules or packages when possible.

Recommendation: in general, submodules are fine; migrate to an R package if/when the shared code matures.

### Dev Container workflows

You can run your environment either as a single-image devcontainer (simple) or via Docker Compose (two services: base and archr). Both approaches bind your project into the container and let you use VS Code Remote - Containers.

#### A) Single-image devcontainer.json (simple)

Example:
```jsonc
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "image": "scdock-r-dev:v0.4.1",
  "workspaceMount": "source=/abs/path/to/your/project,target=/workspaces/project,type=bind",
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/project",
  "runArgs": ["--memory=128g","--cpus=60"],
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": { "extensions": [
      "rdebugger.r-debugger","reditorsupport.r","quarto.quarto",
      "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker","ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers",
      "ms-python.python"
    ]}
  },
  "postStartCommand": "bash -lc 'chmod +x .devcontainer/scripts/poststart_sanity.sh && .devcontainer/scripts/poststart_sanity.sh'"
}
```
- VS Code: Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
- R: `r-base` for radian (base lib), `r-archr` for ArchR toggle
- Python venv switching: `usepy base|squid|atac|comms`

#### B) Compose-based devcontainer.json (multi-variant)

`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` defines `dev-core` and `dev-archr` services. Use this `devcontainer.json` (recommended default is `dev-archr`):
```jsonc
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "dockerComposeFile": ".devcontainer/docker-compose.yml",
  "service": "dev-archr",      # or "dev-core"
  "workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/project",
  "customizations": { "vscode": { "extensions": [
    "reditorsupport.r","ms-python.python","ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers"
  ]}}
}
```
- Switch services by changing `service` and Reopen in Container, or attach to the running container.
- Same commands inside as in the single-image flow (radian wrappers, `usepy` switchers).

Important: r-base/r-archr vs service choice

- Service `dev-core` (image: scdock-r-dev):
  - `r-base` works (base R libs).
  - `r-archr` only sets `USE_ARCHR=1`; ArchR is NOT installed here → `library(ArchR)` fails. Use the `dev-archr` service when you need ArchR.
- Service `dev-archr` (image: scdock-r-archr):
  - `r-base` works and does NOT prepend ArchR lib path.
  - `r-archr` sets `USE_ARCHR=1` so `.Rprofile` prepends `ARCHR_LIB`; `library(ArchR)` succeeds.

Recommendation: default to `dev-archr` in development unless you specifically want the leaner `dev-core` image.

### Switching environments quickly

- R (radian front-end):
  - Base: `r-base`
  - ArchR: `r-archr` (sets `USE_ARCHR=1`, prepends `ARCHR_LIB` in `.Rprofile`)
- Python venvs:
  - `usepy base|squid|atac|comms`
  - One-off: `py-base`, `py-squid`, `py-atac`, `py-comms`

### Worked example: RNA + ATAC interoperability and integration

Scenario: You have parallel scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets preprocessed/UMAPed and annotated in Seurat. You want to integrate in Python (scVI/PeakVI or SCGLUE) and run GRN inference (SCENIC+), then round-trip back to Seurat.

1) Start in R for Seurat preprocessing
```bash
r-base   # radian (base libs)
```
- Ensure assays and reductions are in good shape (Seurat v5: counts/data/scale.data).
- Check reductions and graphs:
```r
names(s@reductions); names(s@graphs); Layers(s[["RNA"]])
```

2) Export to Python-friendly formats
- Single-modality RNA or ATAC: write `.h5ad` (faithful with loadings/graphs):
```r
library(MuDataSeurat)
WriteH5AD(object = s, file = "rna.h5ad", assay = "RNA")
```
- True multiome (paired) or to keep modalities together: write `.h5mu`:
```r
WriteH5MU(s, "multiome.h5mu")
```
- Alternative R-only path: `anndataR` reads/writes H5AD natively:
```r
library(anndataR)
s <- read_h5ad("in.h5ad", as = "Seurat")
# or write_h5ad(s, "out.h5ad")
```

3) Switch to Python (base) for scVI/SCGLUE
```bash
usepy base
python -c "import scanpy as sc, muon as mu; print('OK')"
```
- Load data:
```python
import scanpy as sc, muon as mu
m = mu.read_h5mu("multiome.h5mu")  # if multiome
rna = m.mod["RNA"]; atac = m.mod["ATAC"]
# or: rna = sc.read_h5ad("rna.h5ad"); atac = sc.read_h5ad("atac.h5ad")
```
- Compute embeddings (examples):
  - scVI on RNA → store in `obsm['X_scvi']`
  - PeakVI on ATAC → `obsm['X_peakvi']`
  - SCGLUE → `obsm['X_scglue']`
- Ensure standard keys so converters recognize them.

4) Optional: use `usepy atac` if you keep ATAC-only stack separate
```bash
usepy atac   # snapatac2 and ATAC-focused deps
```

5) Write back to disk
- Keep multiome fidelity: `.h5mu`
- Or per-modality `.h5ad` files with embeddings in `obsm` and graphs in `obsp`.

6) Return to R and import
```bash
r-base
```
- Via MuDataSeurat (recommended for fidelity):
```r
library(MuDataSeurat)
# Single assay back from H5AD
s <- Seurat::ReadH5AD("rna.h5ad")
# Multiome
s_multi <- ReadH5MU("multiome.h5mu")
```
- Check round-trip:
```r
names(s@reductions)    # expect pca, umap, tsne, scvi, peakvi, scglue ...
head(Embeddings(s, "pca"))
names(s@graphs)
```

7) Conversion checklists (don’t lose artifacts)
- Before writing H5AD (Python):
  - `adata.X` vs `adata.raw.X` consistent with expectations
  - Embeddings in `obsm`: `X_pca`, `X_umap`, `X_scvi`, `X_peakvi`, `X_scglue`
  - Graphs in `obsp`: connectivities/distances
- After import in R:
  - `names(s@reductions)` contains your embeddings
  - `names(s@graphs)` populated
  - For Seurat v5, `Layers(s[["RNA"]])` includes counts/data/scale

8) GRN inference (SCENIC+)
- Use the COMMS venv for LR/GRN tools:
```bash
usepy comms
python -c "import pycistarget, pycistopic; print('OK')"  # scenicplus via source if needed
```
- If `scenicplus` is required and not preinstalled, install at runtime:
```bash
usepy comms
pip install 'scenicplus @ git+https://github.com/aertslab/SCENICplus.git'
```

### Tips and pitfalls
- Prefer `.h5mu` for true multiome; use `.h5ad` per-assay when needed.
- Use predictable embedding keys (X_scvi, X_peakvi, X_scglue) to preserve reductions on round-trip.
- Large datasets: prefer backed I/O (.h5mu with muon; Seurat v5 disk-aware flows).
- If a reduction/graph is missing after import, re-emit using `MuDataSeurat::WriteH5AD`.

## Permissions, UID/GID, and AD users (group names with spaces)

- Containers run as your host UID/GID (passed at build and used at runtime). This avoids root-owned files on your mounts.
- For AD-controlled users (e.g., primary group name contains a space like `domain users`):
  - The Dockerfile already normalizes/handles group creation via numeric GID and falls back to safe names if needed.
  - When binding a workspace path, ensure the host directory is writable by your UID/GID:
    ```bash
    id -u; id -g; id -gn
    ls -ld /path/to/workspace
    # Adjust on host if needed:
    sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /path/to/workspace
    # or grant group write:
    sudo chmod -R g+rwX /path/to/workspace
    ```
- R user library: the container sets `R_LIBS_USER` and `.Rprofile` prepends it. Startup sanity now checks:
  - R user lib writable
  - Workspace write (creates and removes a temp dir)
  If either fails, the sanity script prints IDs and path info to guide fixes.

- VS Code Dev Containers: When using compose, both services inherit the same mount and user IDs; choose `dev-archr` by default if you want ArchR availability.

## Image slimming (what we removed and how to keep it small)

- Heavy R annotation/data packages moved to optional (install on-demand):
  - BSgenome.* (hg19, hg38, mm10, mm39), EnsDb.* (multiple versions), org.*.eg.db, reactome.db
  - Reason: multi-GB footprint; not always needed for development
  - To install when required:
    ```bash
    # Build with heavy data included
    docker build -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile \
      --build-arg INCLUDE_HEAVY_R_DATA=1 \
      -t scdock-r-dev:heavy .
    ```
    Or inside R at runtime via BiocManager installs.

- Python venv trims:
  - Moved cross R/Py bridging packages to on-demand: pyreadr, rpy2, anndata2ri (commented in base_requirements.txt)
  - Keep heavy stacks only where necessary; avoid duplicating scanpy/scvi across multiple venvs

- Cleanup and build hygiene:
  - Remove build sources after install (R sources are removed; keep iterating where applicable)
  - Consider TinyTeX or minimal TeX set if PDF output isn’t central
  - Optionally purge renv cache in final stage if you don’t need rebuild acceleration

- Quick size audit (inside a container):
  ```bash
  du -hsx /* 2>/dev/null | sort -h | tail -n 20
  du -hs /usr/local/lib/R/library/* | sort -h | tail -n 30
  du -hs /opt/venvs/* | sort -h
  ```
