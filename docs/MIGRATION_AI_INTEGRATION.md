# Migration Notice: AI Branches Deprecated

The `dev-claude-integration` and `dev-gpt-codex-integration` branches are deprecated. AI support is provided via the optional AI‑enabled image integrated with SciAgent‑toolkit.

- Steps to build and use the AI‑enabled image: see `docs/AI_TOOLS.md`.
- MCP/agent configuration and advanced usage: SciAgent‑toolkit → https://github.com/tony-zhelonkin/SciAgent-toolkit
- Optional: tag/archive any local copies of the old branches.
